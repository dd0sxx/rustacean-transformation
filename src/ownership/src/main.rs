    As a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement Copy, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement Copy. Here are some of the types that implement Copy:
    All the integer types, such as u32.
    The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    All the floating point types, such as f64.
    The character type, char.
    Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.
